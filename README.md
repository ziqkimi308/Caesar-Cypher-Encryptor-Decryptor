### Caesar Cypher Encrptor and Decryptor

- The Caesar Cipher Encryptor and Decryptor is a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number (the "shift"). This cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques used in classical cryptography.

### Features:

- Encryption and Decryption: Users can either encrypt (encode) or decrypt messages by providing a shift value.
- Customizable Shift: The shift can be any number, and the program automatically wraps around the alphabet.
- Non-Alphabet Characters: The program maintains spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphabetic characters in the original form without changing them.
- User-Friendly Interface: The program is interactive, with clear instructions and feedback at each step.
